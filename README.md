# Cotton-plant-disease-prediction

## About Application:
* Predict cotton plan disease based on the input image.
* Dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/janmejaybhoi/cotton-disease-dataset
* Train data: 1957 images. Validation data: 324 images. Test data: 18 images
* Trained using RESNET50, INCEPTIONV3 & RESNET152V2 architectures (TRANSFER LEARNING).
* RESNET152V2 offered accuracy: 0.9810 - loss: 0.2066 - val_loss: 0.0000e+00 - val_accuracy: 1.0000 for 20 epochs.
* Application predicts the uploaded image into 1 of the category: <strong>"diseased cotton leaf" </strong>, <strong>"diseased cotton plant" </strong>, <strong>"fresh cotton leaf" </strong>, and <strong>"fresh cotton plant"</strong> 
* Images captured from drone/camera can be used to predict the cotton disease. Whereas, the manual intervention of detecting cotton disease would be difficult for large area of land.
